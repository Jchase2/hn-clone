## What is this? 

It's a <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">hacker news</a> clone built with react. 

## Why? 

At the end of taking Tyler Mcginnis's react course, he recommended building an HN clone in react
to cement the skills I learned. Also, wouldn't hurt to throw it on my resume. I'm building it from 
scratch to test my skills, essentially.
